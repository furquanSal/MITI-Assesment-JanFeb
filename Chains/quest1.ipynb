      "\n",
      "**Ingredients:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch pieces\n",
      "* 1 cup plain yogurt\n",
      "* 1 tablespoon garam masala\n",
      "* 1 teaspoon ground cumin\n",
      "* 1 teaspoon ground coriander\n",
      "* 1 teaspoon turmeric powder\n",
      "* 1 teaspoon red chili powder\n",
      "* 1/2 teaspoon salt\n",
      "* 1/4 cup vegetable oil\n",
      "* 1 onion, thinly sliced\n",
      "* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n",
      "* 1 tablespoon ginger, minced\n",
      "* 1 (28-ounce) can diced tomatoes\n",
      "* 1 cup heavy cream\n",
      "* 1/4 cup chopped cilantro\n",
      "\n",
      "**Instructions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. In a large bowl, combine the chicken, yogurt, garam masala, cumin, coriander, turmeric, chili powder, and salt. Mix well to coat the chicken. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to overnight.\n",
      "2. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken and cook until browned on all sides. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.\n",
      "3. Add the onion to the skillet and cook until softened. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for 1 minute more.\n",
      "4. Stir in the tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened.\n",
      "5. Add the chicken back to the skillet and stir to coat in the sauce. Bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.\n",
      "6. Stir in the heavy cream and cilantro. Serve immediately with rice or naan bread.\n",

      "**Tips:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* For a more flavorful dish, use boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts.\n",
      "* If you don't have garam masala, you can make your own by combining equal parts ground cumin, coriander, cardamom, cloves, and black pepper.\n",
      "* If you like your dish spicy, add an extra 1/4 teaspoon of chili powder.\n",
      "* Serve Chicken Tikka Masala with a side of raita, a yogurt-based sauce with cucumber and mint.\n"
